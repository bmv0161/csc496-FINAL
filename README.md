# csc496: FINAL Project
**Topology sort for course scheduling**

[RAW DATA](https://www.wcupa.edu/sciences-mathematics/computerScience/undergradCourses.aspx)

**Roadmap**
1. Get data from website
2. Create graph data structure
3. Create algorithm for topology
4. Bonus points

**Program**
1. Graph.java: reads raw data and stores directed graph data structure - **Devin**
2. ClassScheduler.java: performs topology sort and outputs four year plan - **Brian**

**Video**
- code demo
- explain how algorithm works: step by step
- **Shaun**

**Bonus**
1. Rewrite the algorithm with a cap of three courses per semester: find the fastest graduation path
2. Build an interactive Web/GUI application to display the algorithm
3. Rewrite the algorithm to fill out the CSC advising sheet: find the fastest graduation path (least amount of semesters
)




**Notes from meeting with Jiang**
- CSC301: no prerequisites
- only consider csc courses
- Bonus 1: max three - hardest - find fastest completion of courses
- Bonus 2: click a button, displays everything, user input possible
- Bonus 3: complete csc courses to graduate the fastest - complete grading sheet
- Video: code demo, display output, explain output, show single round
